# Rock Paper Scissors (freeCodeCamp)

Solution for the freeCodeCamp **Machine Learning with Python** “Rock Paper Scissors” project.

The goal is to implement `player()` in `RPS.py` and win **at least 60%** of games in a 1000-round match against the four provided bots.

## Files
- `RPS.py` — my `player()` implementation (solution)
- `RPS_game.py` — game engine + opponent bots (do not modify)
- `main.py` — run matches locally
- `test_module.py` — unit tests

## Run
```bash
python3 main.py
